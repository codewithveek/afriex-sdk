# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`. It holds all your changesets - that is, files that hold two key bits of information:

1. A version type (major, minor, or patch)
2. Information on what the change is

To add a changeset, run:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This will prompt you to select which packages have been changed, and what type of version bump to apply.

For more information, see the [changeset documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).
